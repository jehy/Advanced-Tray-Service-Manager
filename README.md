Advanced-Tray-Service-Manager
=============================

That's a cool application which allows you to create custom tray menu with service management, application launches, and so on. You can even your own DLL file as plugin for application! It was created in year 2007 while I was a student, so there can (and will) be messy things, but if you want to create a cool tray manager - it's a good thing to start at.

Tray application is written in C++ and WinApi, Setup application - in C++ and MFC, and plugins are written in Delphi.
